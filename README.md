Questions 1
Java and C++ are both general-purpose programming languages, but they have some key differences. 
Java is a compiled language that runs on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means that Java code is compiled into bytecode, which is then executed by the JVM. The JVM is a program that is installed on the user's computer and manages the execution of Java programs. 
C++ is a compiled language that runs directly on the hardware. This means that C++ code is compiled into machine code, which is then executed by the computer's CPU.

The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) :- Is a software environment that provides the necessary libraries and components for running Java applications. The JRE includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), as well as a  number of other components, such as the Java class libraries . 
 
 	 
Here is a step-by-step overview of how the JRE works: 
The user starts a Java application. 
The Java application's bytecode is loaded into the JRE. 
The JRE verifies the bytecode to ensure that it is safe to execute. 
The JRE creates a new thread for the Java application. 
The JRE executes the bytecode for the Java application. 
The Java application runs until it terminates. 
The JRE terminates the thread for the Java application. 

Q2) What is the role of methods in java ? How can we use ‘this’ keyword with local  variables in java ? 
A2) Methods in Java are blocks of code that can be reused throughout a program. They can be used to encapsulate common functionality, improve code readability, and make code more maintainable. 
Methods are also used to pass data between different parts of a program. This can be done by passing arguments to methods and by returning values from methods. 
Methods can be either static or non-static. Static methods are associated with a class and can be called without creating an instance of the class. Non-static methods are associated with an object and can only be called after creating an instance of the class. Example :- public static void main(String[] args) { 
  System.out.println("Hello, world!"); 
} 
This method is called main() and it is the entry point for all Java programs. When a Java program is started, the JVM loads and executes the main() method. 
 
The this keyword in Java can be used to refer to the current instance of the class. It can also be used to refer to local variables in the current method, but this is less common. 
To use the this keyword to refer to a local variable, you must first declare the local variable with the same name as a field in the class. Then, you can use the this keyword to refer to the local variable instead of the field. 
For example, the following code shows how to use the this keyword to refer to a local variable: public class MyClass {   private int field; 
 
  public void myMethod() {     int field = 10; 
 
    System.out.println(this.field); // Prints 0 
  } } 
Q3) What is the use of string class in java? Explain any of its three methods.  
A3)The String class in Java is used to represent a sequence of characters. It is one of the most important classes in the Java library, and it is used in almost every Java program. The String class provides a number of useful methods for working with strings, including: 
CharAt() - Returns the character at a specified index in the string. 
IndexOf() - Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified character or substring in the string. 
Substring() - Returns a substring of the string, starting at a specified index and ending at another specified index. 
These three methods are some of the most commonly used String class methods. Here is a brief explanation of each method: 
CharAt() - The charAt() method takes an integer index as an argument and returns the character at that index in the string. For example, the following code would print the character 'H' to the console: 
String myString = "Hello, world!"; char firstChar = myString.charAt(0); System.out.println(firstChar); // Prints 'H' 
Index Of () - The indexOf() method takes a character or substring as an argument and returns the index of the first occurrence of that character or substring in the string. If the character or substring is not found in the string, the method returns -1. For example, the following code would print the number 1 to the console, which is the index of the first occurrence of the character 'l' in the string: 
String myString = "Hello, world!";      int indexOfL = myString.indexOf('l') 
System.out.println(indexOfL); // Prints 1 
substring() - The substring() method takes two integer arguments, start Index and end Index, and returns a substring of the string, starting at start Index and ending at end Index - 1. For example, the following code would print the substring "ello" to the console: 
String myString = "Hello, world!"; 
String substring = myString.substring(1, 5) 
System.out.println(substring); // Prints "ello" 
Q4) WHY ARE EXCEPTION IN JAVA ? HOW CAN WE HANDLE THESE. 
A4) Exceptions in Java are unexpected events that occur while a program is running. They can be caused by a variety of factors, such as user inputrerrors, hardware failures, or network problems. 
Exceptions are important in Java because they allow programmers to handle errors gracefully and prevent their programs from crashing. When an exception occurs, the Java runtime environment (JRE) throws an exception object. The programmer can then catch the exception object and handle it appropriately. 
There are two main ways to handle exceptions in Java: 
Try-catch: The try-catch statement is the most common way to handle exceptions in Java. It allows the programmer to specify a block of code that should be executed if an exception occurs. For example, the following code would print the stack trace of the exception to the console if an exception occurs: 
try { 
  // Code that could potentially throw an exception } catch (Exception e) { 
  e.printStackTrace(); 
} 
Throws: The throws keyword is used to declare that a method throws a specific type of exception. This allows other methods that call the method to be aware of the potential exceptions and handle them accordingly. For example, the following code declares that the open() method throws an IOException: 
 
public void open() throws IOException { 
  // Code that could potentially throw an IOException 
} 
Q5) What do you understand by constructor Overloading? Explain with example how it is different from method overloading? 
A5) Constructor overloading is a feature of Java that allows a class to have multiple constructors with different parameter lists. This allows the class to be initialized in different ways, depending on the needs of the application. 
Constructor overloading is implemented by having multiple constructors with the same name, but with different parameter lists. The Java compiler will choose the correct constructor to call based on the parameters that are passed when the object is created. 
Constructor overloading can be used to implement a variety of features, such as: 
Allowing different types of initialization: For example, a class that represents a student could have two constructors: one that takes a name and a student ID, and another that takes a name and a GPA. 
Providing default values for parameters: For example, a class that represents a rectangle could have a constructor that takes a width and a height, but also a constructor that takes only a width and sets the height to a default value. 
Converting between different object types: For example, a class that represents a date could have a constructor that takes a string representation of the date, and another constructor that takes a number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch. 
 
Constructor overloading and method overloading are two similar concepts in Java, but there are some key differences between them. 
 
 
 
 
 
Constructor overloading and method overloading are two similar concepts in Java, but there are some key differences between them. 
Constructor overloading is the ability of a class to have multiple constructors with different parameter lists. 
This allows the class to be initialized in different ways, depending on the needs of the application. 
Method overloading is the ability of a class to have multiple methods with the same name, but with different parameter lists. This allows the class to perform different operations, depending on the parameters that are passed. 
Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between constructor overloading and method overloading: 
 
 
 
Feature 
Constructor overloading 
Method overloading 


Purpose 
To initialize an object of a class in different ways. 
To perform different operations, depending on the parameters that are passed. 


Invocation 
Constructors are invoked when an object is created. 
Methods are invoked explicitly by the programmer. 


Return type 
Constructors do not have a return type. 
Methods can have any return type, including void. 


Access modifiers 
Constructors can have any access modifier (public, protected, private, or default). 
Methods can have any access modifier (public, protected, private, or default). 


 



Here is an example of constructor overloading: 
public class Student {   private String name;   private int studentID;   public Student(String name, int studentID) {     this.name = name;     this.studentID = studentID; 
  } 
 
  public Student(String name) {     this.name = name;     this.studentID = 0; 
  } 
 
  public String getName() {     return name; 
  } 
 
  public int getStudentID() {     return studentID; 
  } 
} 
This class has two constructors: one that takes a name and a student ID, and another that takes only a name. The first constructor can be used to create a Student object with a specific student ID, while the second constructor can be used to create a Student object with a default student ID of 0. 
Here is an example of method overloading: public class Calculator {   public int add(int a, int b) {     return a + b; 
  } 
 
  public double add(double a, double b) { 
 
    return a + b; 
  } 
} 
This class has two add() methods: one that takes two integers as arguments and returns an integer, and another that takes two doubles as arguments and returns a double. This allows the Calculator class to perform addition on both integers and doubles. 
Constructor overloading and method overloading are both powerful features that can be used to make code more flexible and reusable. By understanding how to use these features, you can write more efficient and maintainable Java code. 
Q6) How can we use final keyword in java? What are arrays of objects? 
A6) He final keyword in Java can be used to declare constants, variables, methods, and classes. 
Constants are values that cannot be changed once they have been initialized. For example, the following code declares a constant called PI with the value of 3.14159: 
final double PI = 3.14159; 
Variables can be declared as final to prevent them from being reassigned. For example, the following code declares a final variable called name: 
final String name = "Alice"; 
Methods can be declared as final to prevent them from being overridden by subclasses. For example, the following code declares a final method called getName():  
public final String getName() {   return name; 
} 
Classes can be declared as final to prevent them from being extended by subclasses. For example, the following code declares a final class called String: 
public final class String { 
  // ... 
} 
 
Arrays in Java are used to store a collection of items of the same data type. They are declared using the [] operator, and the size of the array is specified when it is declared. For example, the following code declares an array of 10 integers: int[] myArray = new int[10]; 
Q7)  What are 2d arrays in java? Write a program to print sum of all positive integer array values.  
A7) A two-dimensional array (2D array) in Java is an array of arrays. This means that each element of a 2D array is itself an array. 2D arrays are useful for representing data in a tabular form, such as a spreadsheet or a chessboard. 
To declare a 2D array in Java, you use the following syntax: 
<data_type>[][] <array_name> = new <data_type>[<number_of_rows>][<number_of_columns>]; 
For example, the following code declares a 2D array of integers with 3 rows and 4 columns:    int[][] myArray = new int[3][4]; 
Here is a program to print the sum of all positive integer array values: public class Sum Of Positive Integer  Array Values {     public static void main(String[] args) {         // Declare and initialize an array of integers. 
        int[] numbers = {1, -2, 3, -4, 5}; 
 
        // Calculate the sum of all positive integers in the array.         int sum = 0;         for (int number : numbers) {             if (number > 0) {                 sum += number; 
            } 
        } 
 
        // Print the sum to the console. 
        System.out.println(sum); 
    } } 
Q8)  Write down the difference between Instance variable and class variable with suitable example. 
Write a program to show working of static and non static blocks in java? 
A8)  
Instance variables are variables that are declared within a class but outside of any method or constructor. They are associated with individual objects of the class. 
Class variables are variables that are declared with the static keyword. They are associated with the class itself, not with individual objects of the class. 


Non-static blocks in Java are code blocks that are executed before the constructor of the class. They are used to initialize instance variables and perform other tasks that need to be done before the constructor is called. 
Static blocks in Java are code blocks that are executed before the main method of the class. They are used to initialize class variables and perform other tasks that need to be done before the main method is called . 
class MyClass { 
    // Instance variable 
    private String name; 
 
    // Class variable     private static int count = 0; 
 
    // Non-static block 
    { 
        name = "Alice"; 
    } 
 
    // Static block     static {         count = 10; 
    } 
 
    // Constructor     public MyClass() { 
    } 
 
    // Method     public void printName() { 
        System.out.println(name); 
    } 
 
    // Static method     public static int getCount() {         return count; 
    } 
} 
Q9)What are command line arguments in java ? Write a program to show the use of wrapper class for printing sum of all positive integers as passed through command line arguments. 
A9) command line arguments in Java are values that are passed to a Java program when it is started. They can be used to specify input data or other configuration options for the program. 
Wrapper classes in Java are classes that represent the primitive data types in Java. They provide additional functionality, such as the ability to parse strings to primitive data types and convert primitive data types to strings. 
Here is a program to show the use of a wrapper class for printing the sum of all positive integers as passed through command line arguments: import java.util.Arrays; import java.util.stream.IntStream; 
 
public class SumOfPositiveIntegerCommandLineArguments { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Get the command line arguments. 
        String[] arguments = args; 
 
        // Check if there are any command line arguments. 
        if (arguments.length == 0) { 
            System.out.println("Usage: SumOfPositiveIntegerCommandLineArguments <positive integers>"); 
            System.exit(1); 
        }  
        // Convert the command line arguments to integers. 
        int[] numbers = Arrays.stream(arguments) 
                .mapToInt(Integer::parseInt) 
                .toArray(); 
 
        // Calculate the sum of all positive integers in the array. 
        int sum = IntStream.of(numbers) 
                .filter(number -> number > 0) 
                .sum(); 
 
        // Print the sum to the console. 
        System.out.println(sum); 
    } 
} 
$ java SumOfPositiveIntegerCommandLineArguments 1 2 3 4 5 15 
 
Q10)What is the use of char data type in java? Write a program to override any of object class method. 
 
A10) The char data type in Java is used to represent a single character. It is a 16-bit data type that can represent any character in the Unicode character set. 
Here are some of the uses of the char data type in Java: 
To represent characters in strings. 
To represent characters in input and output streams. 
To represent characters in character arrays. 
To represent characters in switch statements. 
To represent characters in regular expressions. 

Here is a program to override the toString() method of the Object class: public class MyObject extends Object {     private String name; 
 
    public MyObject(String name) {         this.name = name; 
    } 
 
    @Override 
    public String toString() {         return "MyObject{" + 
                "name='" + name + '\'' + 
                '}'; 
    } 
 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        MyObject myObject = new MyObject("Alice"); 
 
        System.out.println(myObject); 
    } 
} 
Output: 
MyObject{name='Alice'}
